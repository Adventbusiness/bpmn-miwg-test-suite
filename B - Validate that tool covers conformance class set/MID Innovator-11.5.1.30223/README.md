### Metamodel constraints

* Associations of an text annotation cannot be assigned any attributes (like a name).
* Data associations cannot be assigned be a name.
* A call activity (e.g. calling a global task) cannot be assigned a stereotype (user, service, ...).
* I am not aware how to model a collapsed sub process.
* I am not aware how to model an expanded call activity.
* I am not aware how to model a group.
* The Innovator metamodel requires additional elements to be created (e.g., Event Definitions). Typically, they need to have names. These elements are named with the prefix "UNNAMED" in the model.
